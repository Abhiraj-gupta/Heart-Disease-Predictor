**Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning**

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient based on clinical features such as age, cholesterol, chest pain type, resting ECG results, blood pressure, and more.
The project uses multiple ML algorithms — Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN — and compares their performance to determine which model works best.
